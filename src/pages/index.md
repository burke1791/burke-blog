    at Urbana-Champaign in 2013 with a degree in Nuclear Engineering. I am now
    working as a software engineer, specializing in Microsoft SQL Server and a
    little bit of React.
heading: Interests and Side Projects
description: I have a number of hobbies and side projects I like to work on in
  my spare time. My favorite is a web app centered around March Madness. Instead
  of a typical bracket pool, this app hosts a live Calcutta auction for you and
  your friends.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
