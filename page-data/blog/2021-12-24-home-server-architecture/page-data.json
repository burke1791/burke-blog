My \"Stage\" server is running on a Macbook Pro 2012 and the \"Production\" server is an Acer Aspire laptop I purchased for college back in 2009 or 2010. I am also using the Raspberry Pi as a DNS server so I can use human readable domain names on my local network instead of local IP addresses.</p>\n<h2>Installing Ubuntu Server</h2>\n<p>Installation is very simple and straightforward so I won't go into it here, but you can visit the Ubuntu website <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/installation\">here</a> for detailed instructions.</p>\n<p>The issue I encountered after installation was the wifi cards not working. Thankfully both of these laptops are old enough to have ethernet ports built in so I could easily access the internet by plugging into the router.</p>\n<p>Both of these laptops have Broadcom wireless cards, and I had to manually install a couple extra packages in order to get them to work. Luckily this problem has plagued many people before me because there is an <em>outstanding</em> askubuntu <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/55868/installing-broadcom-wireless-drivers/\">answer</a> about this very issue.</p>\n<p>Once I got the wireless cards working, it was smooth sailing.</p>\n<h2>Installing Microsoft SQL Server</h2>\n<p>Again, I'm going to link an external page because Microsoft put together some very easy instructions for installing SQL Server on Linux <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu?view=sql-server-ver15\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>For my projects, I installed SQL Server Developer Edition, as well as both SSIS and SQL Agent - I use both in my personal finance app. However, SSIS ended up causing quite a headache because I noticed my machine was running at 80C while idling - this is absurdly high.</p>\n<p>Using <code>htop</code>, I noticed the <code>ssis-telemetry</code> service was the primary resource hog. The telemetry service is its own service separate from SSIS itself, so I just stopped and disabled it. After that, the machine was idling at a much more comfortable 40C.</p>\n<h2>Installing Nginx</h2>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 24, 2021","title":"Home Server Architecture","description":"I have a couple old laptops laying around the house and thought now might be a good time to set up some home servers.
