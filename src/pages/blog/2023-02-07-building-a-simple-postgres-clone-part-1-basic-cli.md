I﻿f you're reading this because you're interested in postgres internals, I suggest skipping to the next post. This article only covers setting up a very basic cli interface that we'll use to interact with the database later on.

A﻿ll of the code in this article is pretty much directly copied from the first blog post in `cstack`'s series: [link](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/parts/part1.html).
