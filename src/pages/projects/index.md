### March Madness Calcutta

Live site: [https://calcuttaleague.com](https://calcuttaleague.com).

Repos: [Front End](https://github.com/burke1791/march-madness-calcutta) | [Back End](https://github.com/burke1791/march-madness-calcutta-api)

This is a full stack web app that runs a March Madness Calcutta pool for you and your friends. It will host a live auction for everyone to bid on the teams they want, and keep track of payouts as the tournament progresses.

The front end is built with React and hosted through Firebase hosting; however, I'll probably end up moving to AWS Route 53 and S3 for hosting since the back end is all on AWS.

The back end consists of API Gateway calling a bunch of lambda functions which connect to a MS SQL Server instance running in AWS RDS.
