  description: My name is Chris Burke, I graduated from the University of Illinois
    at Urbana-Champaign in 2013 with a degree in Nuclear Engineering. I am now
    working as a software engineer, specializing in Microsoft SQL Server and a
    little bit of React.
heading: Interests and Side Projects
description: I have a number of hobbies and side projects I like to work on in
  my spare time. My favorite is a web app centered around March Madness. Instead
  of a typical bracket pool, this app hosts a live Calcutta auction for you and
  your friends.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
